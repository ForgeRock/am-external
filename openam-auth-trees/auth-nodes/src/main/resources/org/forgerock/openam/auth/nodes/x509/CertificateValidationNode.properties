nodeDescription=Certificate Validation Node
matchCertificateInLdap=Match Certificate in LDAP
matchCertificateInLdap.help=The client certificate must exist in the directory for the authentication to be successful.
checkCertificateExpiry=Check Certificate Expiration
checkCertificateExpiry.help=Check to see if the certificate is expired.
ldapCertificateAttribute=Subject DN Attribute Used to Search LDAP for Certificates
ldapCertificateAttribute.help=This is the attribute used to search the directory for the certificate.<br><br>The \
  Certificate node will search the directory for the certificate using the search filter based on this attribute \
  and the value of the Subject DN taken from the certificate.
matchCertificateToCRL=Match Certificate to CRL
matchCertificateToCRL.help=The Client Certificate will be checked against the Certificate Revocation list held in the\
   directory.<br><br>A Certificate Revocation List can be provisioned into the directory. Having this option enabled \
  will cause all client certificates to be checked against this list.
crlMatchingCertificateAttribute=Issuer DN Attribute(s) Used to Search LDAP for CRLs
crlMatchingCertificateAttribute.help=This is the name of the attribute taken from the CA certificate that will be \
  used to search the CRL.<br><br>If only one attribute name is specified, the ldap search filter will be \
  (attrName=Value_of_the_corresponding_Attribute_from_SubjectDN) e.g. SubjectDN of issuer cert 'C=US, CN=Some CA, \
  serialNumber=123456',attribute name specified is 'CN', search filter used will be <code>(CN=Some CA)</code>\
  .<br><br>If several attribute names are specified, they have to separated by ,. The resulting ldap search filter \
  value will be a comma separated list of name attribute values, the search attribute will be cn e.g. SubjectDN of \
  issuer cert 'C=US, CN=Some CA, serialNumber=123456',attribute names specified are 'CN, serialNumber', search filter \
  used will be <code>cn=CN=Some CA,serialNumber=123456</code>. The order of the values of the attribute names matter\
   as they must match the value of the cn attribute of a crlDistributionPoint entry in the directory server.
crlHttpParameters=HTTP Parameters for CRL Update
crlHttpParameters.help=These parameters will be included in any HTTP CRL call to the Certificate Authority.<br><br>If \
   the Client or CA certificate contains the Issuing Distribution Point Extension then OpenAM will use this \
  information to retrieve the CRL from the distribution point. This property allow custom HTTP parameters to be \
  included in the CRL request.<br><br>The format of the parameter is as follows:<br><code>param1=value1,\
  param2=value</code>
matchCACertificateToCRL=Match CA Certificate to CRL
matchCACertificateToCRL.help=The CA certificate that issued the client certificate will also be checked against the CRL.
cacheCRLsInMemory=Cache CRLs in Memory
cacheCRLsInMemory.help=The CRLs will be cached in memory.
updateCRLsFromDistributionPoint=Update CA CRLs from CRLDistributionPoint
updateCRLsFromDistributionPoint.help=Fetch new CA CRLs from CRLDistributionPoint and update it in Directory Server\
  .<br><br>If the CA certificate includes an IssuingDistributionPoint or has an CRLDistributionPoint extension set \
  OpenAM tries to update the CRLs if needed (i.e. CRL is out-of-date).<br>This property controls if the update should \
  be performed.<br>This property is only used if CA CRL checking is enabled.
ocspValidationEnabled=OCSP Validation
ocspValidationEnabled.help=Enable Online Certificate Status Protocol validation for OCSP aware certificates\
  .<br><br>If the certificate contains OCSP validation information then OpenAM will use this information to check the\
   validity of the certificate as part of the authentication process.<br><br>The OpenAM server must have Internet \
  connectivity for OCSP to work.
certificateLdapServers=LDAP Server Where Certificates are Stored
certificateLdapServers.help=Use this list to set the LDAP server used to search for certificates.<br><br>The \
  Certificate authentication node will use this list for the LDAP server used to search for certificates. A single \
  entry must be in the format:<br><code>ldap_server:port</code><br><br>Multiple entries allow associations between \
  OpenAM servers and a LDAP server. The format is:<br><code>local server name | server:port</code><br><br>The local \
  server name is the full name of the server from the list of servers and sites.
ldapSearchStartDN=LDAP Search Start or Base DN
ldapSearchStartDN.help=The start point in the LDAP server for the certificate and CRL search.<br><br>When entering \
  multiple entries, each entry must be prefixed with a local server name. Multiple entries allow different search \
  Base DNs depending on the OpenAM server in use. The format is:<br><code>local server name | base \
  dn</code><br><br>The local server name is the full name of the server from the list of servers and sites.
userBindDN=LDAP Server Authentication User
userBindDN.help=DN of the user used by the node to authenticate to the LDAP server.<br><br>The Certificate node \
  authenticates to the LDAP server in order to search for a matching certificate. The DN entered here represents the \
  account used for said authentication and must have read/search access to the LDAP server. \
  If mTLS is enabled, this attribute is ignored.
userBindPassword=LDAP Server Authentication Password
userBindPassword.help=The password for the authentication user. If mTLS is enabled, this attribute is ignored.
mtlsEnabled=mTLS Enabled
mtlsEnabled.help=Enables mTLS (mutual TLS) between AM and this store. \
  When mTLS is enabled:\
  <ul><li>Set SSL enabled to <code>true</code>. \
  <li>The values for <code>LDAP Server Authentication User</code> and <code>LDAP Server Authentication Password</code> \
  are ignored.</li>\
  <li>You must provide an <code>mTLS Secret Label Identifier</code>.</li></ul>\
  Instructions for setting up certificates and keystore mappings are in the product documentation.
mtlsSecretLabel=mTLS Secret Label Identifier
mtlsSecretLabel.help=Label identifier used to create a secret label for mapping to the mTLS certificate in the secret \
  store. <br> AM uses this identifier to create a specific secret label for this node. The secret label takes the form \
  <code>am.authentication.nodes.certificate.validation.mtls.{{identifier}}.cert</code> where {{identifier}} is the \
  value of mTLS Secret Label Identifier. The label identifier can only contain characters {{a-z}} {{A-Z}} {{0-9}} \
  {{.}} and cannot start or end with {{.}}.
sslEnabled=Use SSL/TLS for LDAP Access
sslEnabled.help=The certificate node will use SSL/TLS to access the LDAP server.
prompt=Certificate Callback Prompt
prompt.help=The prompt used to request the X.509 Certificate.
