NOTE: The certificates used for the unit tests here and presented in this directory are the same as those used in the functional tests and provided under the
`tests/temper-functional-tests/openam-functional-tests/src/test/resources/certificatechain/` directory.

If these certificates require regenerating in the future the instructions in
[this README](https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/OPENAM/repos/openam/browse/tests/temper-functional-tests/openam-functional-tests/src/test/resources/certificatechain/README.md) 
can be followed and both locations should be updated.
