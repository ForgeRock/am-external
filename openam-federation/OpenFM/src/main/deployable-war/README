OpenSSO - Deployable WAR 

This directory contains the OpenSSO deployable WAR file
(opensso.war which contains all server components and server samples), 
and files/directories required to create some specialized WAR files.

The following specialized WAR files are supported:
  - Console Only WAR (fam-console.list)
  - Server without console WAR (fam-noconsole.list)
  - Distributed Authentication WAR (fam-distauth.list)
  - SAMLv2/ID-FF IDP Discovery/Introduction WAR (fam-idpdiscovery.list)

Contents of this directory:
  <zip staging area>            (root directory where opensso.zip is extracted)
   |- opensso                   (parent directory)
     |- deployable-war          (current directory)
       |- README                (this README file)
       |- createwar.sh          (shell script to create WAR files)
       |- createwar.bat         (bat file to create WAR files)
       |- opensso.war           (OpenSSO Server WAR with samples)
       |- fam-idpdiscovery.list (files list for IDP Discovery WAR)
       |- fam-distauth.list     (files list for Distributed Authentication WAR)
       |- fam-console.list      (files list for Console Only WAR)
       |- fam-noconsole.list    (files list for Server without console WAR)
       |- classes               (contains resources and classes for executing
       |                         createwar.sh and createwar.bat)
       |- idpdiscovery          (directory containing additional files for
       |                         IDP discovery WAR)
       |- distauth              (directory containing additional files for
       |                         Distributed Authentication WAR) 
       |- console               (directory containing additional files for
       |                         Console Only WAR)
       |- noconsole             (directory containing additional files for
                                 Server without console WAR)


Steps to create a specialized WAR file:

1. Creates a new directory as staging area for the server WAR, and extracts the 
   opensso.war in this staging directory:
   % mkdir <server war staging area>
   % cd <server war staging area>
   % jar xvf <zip staging area>/opensso/deployable-war/opensso.war

2. Creates the specialized WAR file using createwar.sh or createwar.bat. 
   (Please remember that createwar.sh and createwar.bat needs to be executed in
    its current directory to be able to find the type-specific additional 
    files)
   For example, to create Console WAR:
   % ./createwar.sh -s /tmp/staging -t console -w /tmp/console.war

Now the specialized WAR is ready to be deployed into your web container.

After deploying the WAR, access the WAR deployment URL 
(e.g. http://moonriver.eng.sun.com/console) from your browser. A configurator 
JSP page will be displayed for you to enter the configuration information 
for the special WAR. Enter the fields and submit the data, a configuration file 
(e.g. AMConfig.properties) will be created under your home directory. It is 
highly recommended that you change the permission of the configuration file 
to limit access to the sensitive configuration information. 
Now you could access the special WAR for its functions.
