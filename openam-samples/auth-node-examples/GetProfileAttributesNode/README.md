<b>Get Profile Authentication Node</b>
<br/>
A simple authentication node that gets user profile attributes and copies them to the authentication tree shared state. Caution: since this node can read to user profile attributes it should only be used towards the end of an authentication journey, after the user has reached a sufficient authentication level.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Installation</b>
<br/>
Copy the .jar file from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed.  Restart the web container to pick up the new node.  The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Usage</b>
<br/>
Deploy the node and set appropriate key/value pairs where:
<br>
key: name of the users profile attribute (e.g., givenName, sn, employeeNumber)
<br>
value: name of an authentication shared state value (e.g., authLevel) or a literal string in quotes (e.g., "Jones")
<br/>
<br/>
<b>To Build</b>
<br/>
Edit the necessary GetProfilePropertyNode.java as appropriate.  To rebuild, run "mvn clean install" in the directory containing the pom.xml
