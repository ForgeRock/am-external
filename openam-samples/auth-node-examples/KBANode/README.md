<b>KBA Authentication Node</b>
<br/>
An authentication decision node which prompts with a random question from the user's set of KBAs. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Installation</b>
<br/>
Copy the .jar file from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed.  Restart the web container to pick up the new node.  The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Usage</b>
<br/>
The node uses KBAs defined in a user's profile by the user self-service module. Enable the self-service module and allow a user to register one or questions during registration or in their profile page. This node will then pick a random question from the profile and prompt for the answer. The node outcome is either true or false depending on the users response.
<br/>
<br/>
