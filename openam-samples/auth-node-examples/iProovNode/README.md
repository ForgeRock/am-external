<b>iProov Authentication Node</b>
<br/>
An authentication node based on iProov's biometric Flashmark technology: https://www.iproov.com 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Installation</b>
<br/>
Copy the .jar file from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed.  Restart the web container to pick up the new node.  The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Usage</b>
<br/>
The node should be used in conjunction with a valid iProov account. Create an authentication tree incorporating this node and configure the the iProov API key, iProov secret, and an appropriate user profile which stores the user's iProov username (e.g., mail). When the node is invoked it retrieves the user's iProov username from their profile and triggers an iProov authentication flow. The user authenticates using the iProov app installed on their registered mobile device.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>To Build</b>
<br/>
Edit the necessary iProovNode.java as appropriate.  To rebuild, run "mvn clean install" in the directory containing the pom.xml
