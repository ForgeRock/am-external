# OpenAM Sample Policy Evaluation Plugin

## About

This sample code demonstrates an OpenAM plugin library
that implements the service provider interfaces
for evaluating policy and returning resource attributes for the ForgeRock Identity Platform 5.1.0 (aka OpenAM 14.1.0)

For instructions on using this sample policy evaluation
plugin with OpenAM, see the section
*[Customizing Policy Evaluation With a Plug-In](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/5.1/authorization-guide/#sec-policy-spi)* in the *AM 5.1 Authorization Guide*.

## Building the Sample
The binary dependencies of the project are held in the ForgeRock artifactory repository. In order to authenticate to that repository it is necessary to have a forgerock subscription. To set up maven to authenticate to the ForgeRock repository please follow the instructions in the following ForgeRock Knowledge Base article;
