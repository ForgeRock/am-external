    /**
    * Facility to assist migration from callback-based functions to promise-based ones
    *
    * Many legacy functions exist which are of the style func(successCallback, errorCallback).
    * These functions do not return anything; instead they invoke the appropriate callback function
    * and pass it whatever result they eventually have to provide.
    *
    * This style of function is not particularly easy to work with in the context of a promise.
    * To make these functions easier to work with, this promiseWrapper function exists. It returns a
    * promise which is only resolved or rejected when the success or error callback (respectively) is called.
    *
    * If the functionToCall does actually return something (presumably a promise but not necessarily) then
    * whatever was returned will be used to resolve the promise returned from this function.
    *
    * The second argument to this function is "params" - it is an optional object which may contain
    * "success" and "error" callbacks. This is to continue to provide the legact callback support, if it is desired.
    *
    * Example:

        function login(credentials, successCallback, errorCallback) {
            // try logging in
            // if successful: successCallback(userDetails);
            // else : errorCallback(failureDetails);
        }

        var creds = { "userName": "foo", "password": "bar" };

        ModuleLoader.promiseWrapper(_.curry(login)(creds)).then(
            function (user) {
                console.log("Successfully logged in with user", user);
            },
            function (failureDetails) {
                console.log("Failed to login", failureDetails);
            }
        );

    * Note the use of _.curry above. This is necessary because the function that you may wish to invoke
    * requires other arguments in addition to the two callbacks (such as the credentials in that sample).
